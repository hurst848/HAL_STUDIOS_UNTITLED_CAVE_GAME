/// SENSOR AND DETECTOR DOCUMENTATION ///

// AREA LIGHT SOURCE //
Description:
	- Used when an object needs to emit a spherical ball of light
	- E.x. lantern, campfire

How To Use:
	- Attach as child to gameObject
	- Set values in the script:
		- Range, how far the light goes (float > 0)
	- The monster can now detect this light source

// SPOTLIGHT SOURCE //
Description:
	- Used when an object needs a directional light
	- E.x. torch, light fixtures

How To Use:
	- Attach as child to gameObject
	- Set values in the script:
		- Range, how far the light goes (float > 0)
		- Spot Angle, the angle of the light from the 
		  source (0 < float < 180)
	- The monster can now detect this light source

// SOUND SOURCE //
Description:
	- Used to emit sounds
	- Gives the monster the ability to listen

How To Use:
	- Attach as child to gameObject
	- Set Values in the Audio Source:
		- Volume, monster uses this to judge the
		  the importance of a noise and is the
		  relative loudness of the sound
		  (0 < float <= 1)
	- Set Values in the script:
		- Sound, the sound to be played
		  (any valid audio file)
		- Maximum Listening Distance, the farthest
		  away the sound will be heard and detected
		  (0 < float)
		- Clip Fade, how long the monster can hear the
		  sound after the clip finishes, to simmulate 
		  the travel of sound (0 < float)
	- In code, trigger the sound with the triggerSound()
	  method
	- The monster can now detect this sound source

Description:
	- Prefabs such as AudioDetector and LightDetector are
	  not documented as they require no alteration other
	  than their implementation into the monsters
